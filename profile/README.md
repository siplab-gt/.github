This is the home of software produced by the [Structured Information for Precision Computational Neuroengineering Lab (SIPLab)](https://siplab.gatech.edu) led by Chris Rozell and Sankar Alagapan at Georgia Tech.

Our research focus is in **computational neuroengineering**, an intersection of data science, neurotechnology and computational modeling that aims to advance the understanding of brain function and the design of effective interventions.

See [CLOCTools](https://cloctools.github.io/) for real-time closed-loop optogenetic control software, developed in collaboration with the [Garrett Stanley lab](https://stanley.gatech.edu/).
