This is the home of software produced by the [Sensory Information Processing Lab (SIPLab)](https://siplab.gatech.edu) led by Chris Rozell and Sankar Alagapan at Georgia Tech.

Our research focus is in **computational neuroengineering**, an intersection of data science, neurotechnology and computational modeling that aims to advance the understanding of brain function, the engineering of effective interventions, and the development of intelligent systems.
